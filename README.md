# Cadny-Cursh-go

## A simple candy crush clone which runs in the terminal. And ofcourse it's made from Go.

## **How to Play**

1. Your goal is to match the candies of same colors in a group of three or more (horizontally or vertically) to "Cursh" the candies and score points.
2. Just move the cursor wherever you want and hit space bar to activate the move-candy thing.
3. After that just move again to move(swap) candies.
4. Each candy you destroy yields 1 point.


> I mean no one has done this before in terminal(atleast from my research).
